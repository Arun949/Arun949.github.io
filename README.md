## ✨ Creative & Technical Highlights

### 🎨 Immersive Visual Experience
- **Parallax 3D Landscapes**: Multi-layered background system using high-end AI-generated assets that create a deep sense of spatial immersion.
- **Dynamic Hero Background**: A futuristic 3D data-city visualization that reacts to mouse movements with sub-pixel precision.
- **Neural About Section**: Custom-designed 3D neural network brain visualization integrated into the "About Me" section.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Advanced UI components with blurred surfaces, "magnetic" glow effects that follow the cursor, and tiered depth shadows.
- **Micro-Animations**: Staggered reveal animations and interactive node "particles" that bring the site to life as you navigate.

### ⚡ Performance Engineering
- **Ultra-Smooth Scrolling**: Custom-built scroll system using `requestAnimationFrame` and hardware acceleration hints (`will-change`) for a jitter-free 60fps experience.
- **Optimized Asset Delivery**: Strategic use of CSS gradients and optimized SVG particles to maintain high visual fidelity with minimal payload.
- **Cross-Browser Precision**: Standardized implementations of `background-clip` and other modern CSS properties for consistent rendering across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
